# Creating a T distribution in the values the degree of freedom
When you dont ahave any information of the population 
T distribution when sample lenght is less than 30 if greater than use normal distribution
List of costumers at BNP for example are examples of population. 
If only have 1 % thats a sample
If you have the std of the population can i use other methods

Population can be samples (e.g All the empployees in the next door shop)

1: confidence interval: the probability that our sample attributes (mean, std...) match the values of the population with a margin of error, we usually calculate it with the t-student table scipy.stat.t) because we dont have data of population, but we can use other methods if we hava data from the population.
2: method norm.interval(0,8): we want to discover the interval that a 80% of the population fit in
1 != 2

Definition of Degrees of Freedom
Degrees of freedom are the number of independent values that a statistical analysis can estimate. You can also think of it as the number of values that are free to vary as you estimate parameters. I know, it’s starting to sound a bit murky!
Degrees of freedom encompasses the notion that the amount of independent information you have limits the number of parameters that you can estimate. Typically, the degrees of freedom equal your sample size minus the number of parameters you need to calculate during an analysis. It is usually a positive whole number.
Degrees of freedom is a combination of how much data you have and how many parameters you need to estimate. It indicates how much independent information goes into a parameter estimate. In this vein, it’s easy to see that you want a lot of information to go into parameter estimates to obtain more precise estimates and more powerful hypothesis tests. So, you want many degrees of freedom! (editado) 

INFERENTIAL
We can estimate from the sample the expectation of the population.
In hypothesis test. We want to test something
Were should we starting
- Sample or - hypothesis 
Sample should reflect the hypothesis - We need a sample of what we want to text

(Confident the number is there? - Confident there the value are in the new
interval)
The null hypothesis - Is the parameter they you interested theres a specific singçe value. 

 always need to be equal 
 If that is difference betw
Sample you need to measure otherwise you can't prove anything
Outcome variable  - 
 Null Hypothysis -(disprove) - You can not prove 
 Once we prove we can call the 'reject' the null hypothesis.

 '''Key Concepts
Population - In Statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. For example, say we want to analyze the income data of all residents in New York City. In this case the population is all the NYC residents.

Sample - A sample is a subset of the population chosen to represent the population in statistical analysis. For example, in reality it is impossible to obtain all residents' income information in NYC because there are too many people. In order to analyze NYC residents' income data, we can select a decent number of residents and use their income information to represent all NYC residents. Ideally, the selection of the sample should be randomized in order to avoid sampling bias.

Sampling Bias - Sampling bias occurs when some members of the intended population are less likely to be included than others in the selected sample. Say we collected the data at Wall Street at 10AM on Monday. Significant bias can be introduced due to the flaws of the data collection because people who appear at Wall Street at that specific time are most likely working professionals in the financial industry. The sample data will miss a lot of people from other industries and other NYC neighborhoods. Consequently, the selected sample is not a good representation of NYC residents.

Statistical Hypothesis - A statistical hypothesis is an assumption about the population average. For example, we can assume the average income of NYC residents is $850,000. This assumption may or may not be true.

Null Hypothesis - Denoted with H0, a null hypothesis is an assumption that the population average is identical to a specific value.  The typical notation is μ = μ0, where μ refers to the population mean and μ0 refers to the hypothesized value. For example, a null hypothesis can be that the average NYC residents' income is $850,000. The null hypothesis is represented by:

H0: μ = 850,000
Alternative Hypothesis - An alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis. We compare this hypothesis with the null hypothesis to decide whether or not we reject the null hypothesis. We denote the alternative hypothesis with H1 or Ha. For the previous example of the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis can be any of the following:'''

Define the problem - 
1) Formulate an Hypothesis - Match to the sample 

- Aplha is the probability you willing to be wrong 

HO = (mesasure) = Value / Measure
Há  is Different (< or >)
